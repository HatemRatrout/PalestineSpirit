# Palestine Spirit
## Abstract
We’re excited to share with you Our new website “PalestineSpirit .com”, reimagined to reflect the energy of Palestine. The site marries beautiful design and timely content with bright imagery and video to capture Archaeological sites in Palestine like never before, showcasing the endless possibilities the five boroughs hold for all visitors.
## Main features:
- In the home page users can chose the city they are interested in visiting, and it will direct them to that city’s page.
- Users can walk through city, site, and tours pages to see the pictures, videos, tours, and the location on the map easily without registering.
- When a user tries to join a trip, he/she will be directed to the” login-registration” page, if the user logged in as a guide he’ll be allowed to create a new tour.
- Users also can add reviews on the sites that they have visited before.
<br>
The homepage is broken up the way you might traditionally browse a DMO’s website, with sections like “Tours” “Archaeological sites” and “cities.” But rather than reading long lists, you’re scrolling through gorgeous photos that are the motivation to learn more about old civilizations & their great history.

When Visit, a city pages is simple and visually engaging, the real win here is the videos, the organization is clearly prioritizing video content. But the content itself shows that the video is the next best thing to actually experience the destination, and the Google maps section is the perfect way to link you with the tours page.
